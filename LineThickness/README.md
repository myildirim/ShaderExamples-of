# Line Thickness Shader Example

This example demonstrates:
- Creating polylines
- Generating meshes with vertex/normal data of the polyline and passing it to the shader
- Creating thick lines from the given polyline both on the CPU and the shader side
- Some sliders to adjust the effect on the thickness
